# MotoAPI - in progress

MotoAPI is a project that allows user to create and manage a database of Motoshowrooms and cars assigned to them. With it, user can add, delete and edit MotoShowroom and their cars.
The project also implemented a user login system divided into roles: "Admin", "Manager" and "User". Each role has access to the appropriate functionalities of the application, which allows for effective database management.
